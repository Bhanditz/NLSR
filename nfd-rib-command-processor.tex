\section{NFD RIB Command Processor}
\label{sec:nfd-rib-commands}

The NFD RIB Command Processor allows modification of NLSR's advertised
name prefixes using NFD's RibMgmt commands. Such commands may
originate from something like NFD's Readvertise module, which permits
routes inserted in NFD to be propagated through to NLSR, so that NLSR
can provide routing support for them.

\subsection{Advertising and Withdrawing Routes}
The processor accepts valid RibMgmt commands that have the name prefix
to manipulate the origin of the route specified. No other validation
is performed, as stated below.

The processor does not send any kind of response to commands.

\subsection{Security}
Any RibMgmt commands received on the \texttt{/localhost/nlsr/rib}
prefix are considered secure, and are processed. This introduces a
security hole because anyone who can send a RibMgmt command on this
prefix can arbitrarily manipulate NLSR's advertised prefixes. However,
because sending commands to this prefix requires root access, a
would-be attacker will already have root access locally.
