\section{Prefix Update Processor}
\label{sec:prefix-update}

The Prefix Update processor allows manipulation of NLSR's advertised
name prefixes with ordinary ControlCommands. Such commands may
originate from something like \texttt{nlsrc}, the command line tool
for manipulating NLSR.

\subsection{Advertising and Withdrawing Routes}
The processor accepts valid ControlCommands that are signed by the site operator's key. Additionally, the commands must be received on the \texttt{/localhost/nlsr/prefix-update/} prefix. The full condition list is specified in the validator rules in the configuration file.

The processor will send responses to commands.

\subsection{Security}
Prefix Update commands are similar to NFD RIB commands, but with one
additional requirement, so they are more secure. In addition to being
on the root-only \texttt{/localhost/} prefix, Prefix Update commands
must be signed by the site operator's key. If the site operator's key
were compromised, an attacker could create any number of NLSRs that
impersonate the legitimate NLSR running at that site.
