\section{LSDB Status Dataset}
\label{sec:lsdb-status-dataset}

NLSR makes available the entire contents of the LSDB upon request. A
command can request LSAs of just a specific type, or request the
collection of all LSAs. Unlike the Prefix Update and NFD RIB command
processors, the LSDB Status dataset is available over \emph{both} the
\texttt{/localhost} and regular router prefixes. That is, you can
request an arbitrary router's LSDB contents.

\subsection{Requesting the dataset}
\begin{itemize}
\item To request the local dataset, simply send an Interest of the
  form \texttt{/localhost/nlsr/lsdb/<dataset type>}.
\item To request a remote dataset, send an Interest of the form
  \texttt{/<router name>/lsdb/<dataset type>}, where \texttt{<router
    name>} is whatever the router's name is. This is usually
  \texttt{general.network + general.site + general.router} from the
  configuration file.
\end{itemize}

Where \texttt{<dataset type>} is one of \texttt{names, adjacencies, coordinates} or \texttt{list}.
